      The url that will be configured in the Kubernetes ingress.

      The easiest way of configuring the external-hostname without having the DNS setup is by using
      a Wildcard DNS like nip.io constructing the url like so:
        - nbi.127.0.0.1.nip.io (valid within the K8s cluster node)
        - nbi.<k8s-worker-ip>.nip.io (valid from outside the K8s cluster node)

      This option is only applicable when the Kubernetes cluster has nginx ingress configured
      and the charm is related to the nginx-ingress-integrator.
