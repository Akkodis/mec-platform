summary: OSM Northbound Interface (NBI)

description: |
  A Kubernetes operator that deploys the Northbound Interface of OSM.

  OSM provides a unified northbound interface (NBI), based on NFV SOL005, which enables
  the full operation of system and the Network Services and Network Slices under its control.

  In fact, OSMâ€™s NBI offers the service of managing the lifecycle of Network Services (NS)
  and Network Slices Instances (NSI), providing as a service all the necessary abstractions
  to allow the complete control, operation and supervision of the NS/NSI lifecycle by client
  systems, avoiding the exposure of unnecessary details of its constituent elements.

  This charm doesn't make sense on its own.
